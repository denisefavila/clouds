# Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images

In this project I work with the data from Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images competition on Kaggle.
In this challenge, the main goal is to classify four different types of cloud organization patterns named Fish, Flower, Gravel, Sugar. 

The images were downloaded from NASA Worldview. Three regions, spanning 21 degrees longitude and 14 degrees latitude, were chosen.
The labels were created in a crowd-sourcing activity at the Max-Planck-Institite for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, and the Laboratoire de météorologie dynamique in Paris, France. 

The segment for each cloud formation label for an image is encoded into a single row, even if there are several non-contiguous areas of the same formation in an image. If there is no area of a certain cloud type for an image, the corresponding EncodedPixels prediction should be left blank.
